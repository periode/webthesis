The first \emph{step} in our study of aesthetic standards in source code will identify the aesthetic ideals ascribed by programmers to the source code they write and read; that is, the syntactic qualifiers and semant
ic fields that they refer to when discussing program texts. To that end, we first start by clarifying whom we refer to by the term \emph{programmers}, revealing a multiplicity of practices and purposes, from \emph{ad hoc}, one-line solutions, to printed code and massively-distributed codebases.
