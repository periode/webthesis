# constant public digital writing

what is being made is a system to transform one representation of a document into another one. currently, TeX to HTML. The interesting thing is how close it is tied to content vs. how modular one would like it to be. it is mostly dynamic, and very little is hardcoded, but it has only ever been made or used for one specific document (and a few tests). if you're true to content, every piece is where it should be and therefore can't be modular. one would therefore tend to think of them as antithetical: you can't be absolutely modular if you want to be absolutely true to content (at least in the disciplines of creation).

Which also asks the question of the value of style and uniqueness in this publishing process. let's assume people sometimes want to have something that's always the same (livre de poche), and sometimes want something different (art books). we now have ends of a world: are they parallel? do they connect? à première vue, non. one can trace a rough distinction between mass-production and low-brow, bespoke and high-brow, and they don't mingle so much, even though there are always transfers in certain instances (fashion, music). so the question now is: would they benefit from mingling?

on one side, the arts could be cheaper and more usable (as in, more part of the everyday), possibly with a deep reflection about the usefulness of it all.

on the other side, the factories could be more resonating, by providing things that are a bit more stimulating than the base interchangeable. in our case, this could happen through enough inter-operability that things are put together with enough structure but enough style—the never-ending dilemma.

let's look at it from these two perspectives.

## true to content

the main question: what does it mean to publish research?

the book as an interface, made with the material of ... (digital)

- a book
- a website
- a phd thesis
- a piece of information
- a bunch of resources that eventually are subsumed into a written piece

## true to form

But you can also reveal the content to be a subset of a larger ensemble of data representations.

the starting question: what is the material?

## pre-existing

most projects seem to be between journal systems and book systems; is there an alternative?

modes of reading?

tangential question of centralized hosting vs. decentralized hosting

## features

construction of explorable and adjustable semantic spaces

versioning and continuous deployment

connectivity and referencing

appropriateness as mutability (diversity and dynamic of layout)

exchange: commenting, highlighting (which system to use? PubPub or Hypothesis?)

## processes

exploring and gathering

writing

publishing

## values

accessibility

resilience

resilient (double-edged, self-hosting is tricky)
