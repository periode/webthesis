By examining program texts and the discourses around it, we highlight how source code aesthetics are both dependent on the context in which they are written, and contingent to other literary, architectural, and scientific aesthetics. Particularly, we show how the aesthetic properties of source code manifest expressive power due to their existence as a dynamic, functional and shared computational interface to the world.","index":0}],"tag":"paragraph","value":"","index":0}],"tag":"abstract","value":"","index":0}]
