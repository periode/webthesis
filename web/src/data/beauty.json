Working on literary allusions, Ziva Ben-Porat shows that this simultaneous activation of two texts is influenced by several factors. First, the form of the linguistic token itself has a large influence over the understanding of what it alludes to. Its aesthetic manifestation, then, can be said to modulate the conceptual structures which will be acquired by the reader. Second, the context in which the alluding token(s) appears also influences the correct interpretation of such an allusion, and thus the overall understanding of the text. This contextual approach, once again hints at the change of scale that Ricoeur points in his shift from the word to the sentence, and demands that we focus on the whole, rather than single out isolated instances of linguistic beauty. Finally, a third factor is the personal bagage (a personal encyclopedia) brought by the reader. Such a bagage consists of varying experience levels, of quality of the know-how that is to be activated during the reading process, and of the cognitive schemas that readers carry with them. Imagination in literary interpretation, builds on these various aspect, from the very concrete form and choice of the words used, to the unspoken knowledge structures held in the reader's mind, themselves depending on varied experience levels.

It seems that the imaginative process depends in part on visual and spatial projections, and suggests the fitness of the conceptual structures depicted. By describing situations which, while fictional, nonetheless are possible in a reality often very similar to the one we live in, it is easy for the reader to connect and understand the point being made by the author. So if literature is an object of knowledge, both sensual and conceptual, offering an interplay between rational and imaginative thought, it still relies on the depiction of mostly familiar situations (the protagonists physiologies, the rules of gravity, the fundamental social norms are rarely challenged). A first issue that we encounter here, in trying to connect source code and computing to this line of thought, is that code has close to no sensual existence, beyond its textual form. In trying to communicate concepts, states and processes related to code and computing, and in being unable to depict them by their own material and sensual properties, we once again resort to linguistic processes which enable the bringing-into-thinking of the program text.","index":0}],"tag":"paragraph","value":"","index":682},{"children":[{"children":[{"children":[{"children":null,"tag":"options","value":"","index":0},{"children":null,"tag":"literal","value":"./corpus/unhandled_love.java","index":0}],"tag":"code","value":"java","index":0},{"children":[{"children":null,"tag":"literal","value":"Unhandled Love, by Daniel Bezera, published in \\{code poems\\}","index":0},{"children":[{"children":null,"tag":"literal","value":"bertram_code_2012","index":0}],"tag":"citation","value":"","index":682}],"tag":"caption","value":"","index":0},{"children":[{"children":null,"tag":"literal","value":"code:unhandled-love","index":0}],"tag":"label","value":"beauty","index":0}],"tag":"listing","value":"code:unhandled-love","index":0}],"tag":"paragraph","value":"","index":683},{"children":[{"children":null,"tag":"literal","value":"The code poem listed in","index":0},{"children":[{"children":null,"tag":"literal","value":"code:unhandled-love","index":0}],"tag":"reference","value":"","index":0},{"children":null,"tag":"literal","value":"suggests a similar phenomenon when it comes to perceiving motions and sensations through words.

A similar phenomenon happens in source code, in which the meaning of a particular expression or statement can be derived from itself, or from a larger context. In object-oriented programming, the process of inheritance across classes allows for the meaning of a particular subclass to be mostly defined in terms of the fields and methods of its subclasses—its meaning is compressed by relying on a semantic environment, which might or not be immediately visible. This, Gabriel says, induces a tension between extendability (to create a new subclass, one must only extend the parent, and only add the differentiating aspects) and context-awareness (one has to keep in mind the whole chain of properties in order to know exactly what the definition of an interface that is being extended really is).
