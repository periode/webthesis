# webthesis

this project takes a specific latex file, parses an AST, and renders it as an HTML collection.

the parsing is done in rust with a grammar written with pest.

the rendering is done in the svelte flavor of HTML/CSS/JS.

## notes

the book as an interactive AST

between tradition and modernity

flexiblity and reliability

spatiality

what can be done just with formatting? what needs to be integrated in the writing process (like the compiler phase of craftinginterpreters)

what is the meaningful unit of the book?
